🧹 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation

Cleaned, filtered, and transformed raw API data using Power Query.

Structured fields for modeling and analysis.

🧩 3. Data Modeling

Built a proper data model to support dynamic visuals.

Ensured smooth relationships for accurate calculations.

📊 4. Interactive Dashboard Design

Designed a clean and intuitive dashboard showing:

Temperature trends

Humidity levels

Wind speed

Condition summaries

Other weather insights

Focused on clarity, storytelling, and user experience.
